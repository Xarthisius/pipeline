# This is a exmaple of a Procfile which can be used for 
# starting services during development. All you need to do is copy this
# example to ./Procfile and adapt to your needs. You can use honcho 
# (remcommended) or foreman (ruby) to start the file.

# The following entries need adaption to your environment. For exmaple
# if you don't have redis already running, you need to uncomment the
# respective lines.

#redis: redis-server share/init/redis.conf
celery: python manage.py celeryworker 
web: python manage.py runserver --threaded 

# uncomment this line to use SMTP dummy server
#smtp: sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25

# use this line istead, to allow outside access to your dev box
#web: python manage.py runserver --threaded --host=0.0.0.0
